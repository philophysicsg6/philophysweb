                <br>Radiation consists of photons and Matter consists of atoms and molecules. Thus, Interaction of
                radiation with Matter means interaction of photons with atoms and molecules. The three processes that
                coexist at all temperatures whenever radiation interacts with matter are absorption, emission and
                stimulated emission.

Explain the terms population inversion, Active medium, meta stable state, pumping.</span></strong><strong>(M.U. Dec. 2008,09,10,17) (8m)
                </strong><br><br>
                <strong>Population inversion: </strong>Every system in nature tries to achieve minimum potential energy. Thus, naturally majority of atoms in every system lie in the ground state and a very few are present in excited state, this is called the natural population. In order for the stimulated emission to occur we require majority of atoms to be present in the excited state and very few in the ground state i.e., just inverse of the natural population. Once this condition is achieved. The state of population inversion is said to be achieved.<br>
               <br><strong>Active medium: </strong>The medium in which light gets amplified is called active medium. It may be solid, liquid or gases. Out of all atoms present in medium only few are responsible for stimulated emission and consequent light amplification, they are called active centres.<br>
               <br><strong>Meta stable state: </strong>: The state which has energy in between that of ground state and excited state is called meta stable state. This is a partially stable state. The life time of atoms is in between their respective life time is ground state and excited states.<br>
               <br><strong>Pumping:</strong>: To obtain and maintain a state of population inversion atoms have to be raised continuously to excited state. It requires energy to be supplied to the system. The process of supplying energy to the medium with a view to transfer it into the excited state is pumping.
               Techniques for pumping are,<br>
               <br>1.<strong>Optical pumping: </strong>Light source used for pumping.<br>
               <br>2.<strong>Electric pumping: </strong>Electric field is applied to medium producing ionisation creating excitation.<br>
             <br>3,<strong>Chemical pumping:</strong>When chemical reaction is used for excitation.

               <br>When stimulated emission is generated in medium it has to be sustained in the desired direction and suppressed in remaining direction. This goal can be achieved by resonant cavity. Resonant Cavity consist of two oppositely facing parallel mirrors with active medium placed in between them as shown in Figure 2a.5.1.
               <br><br><div class="imgee">
                <img src="./img/lim4.png" height="400" width="700">
            </div>
               <br>The action of such a cavity can be explained as follows:<br>
               <br>1.	Ground state: Initially active centres are in ground state as shown in Figure 2a.5.2.<br>
               <br><div class="imgee">
                <img src="./img/lim5.png" height="400" width="700">
            </div>
               <br>2.	 Optical pumping: By optical pumping the material is taken to a state of population inversion as shown in Figure 2a.5.3.<br>
               <br><div class="imgee">
                <img src="./img/lim6.png" height="400" width="700">
            </div>
               <br>3.	Spontaneous and stimulated emission: Spontaneous occur in random direction and they thus produce stimulated emission as shown in Figure 2a.5.4. <br>
               <br><div class="imgee">
                <img src="./img/lim7.png" height="400" width="700">
            </div>
               <br>4.	Optical feedback: Due to reflecting mirrors photons in favourable direction are feedback as shown in Figure 2a.5.5.<br>
               <br><div class="imgee">
                <img src="./img/lim8.png" height="400" width="700">
            </div>
               <br>5.	Light amplification: Feedback from mirrors combined with stimulated emissions will lead to light multiplication and then light amplification.<br>
               <br>6.	Light oscillation : Light beam in the cavity begins to oscillate when the amount of amplified light becomes equal to the total amount of light lost through the sides of the resonator as shown in Figure 2a.5.5. Then waves propagating in the cavity take the standing wave pattern. If L is the length of the cavity. <br>
               <div>$$ {2L = m\lambda;} $$</div>
               <br><div>$$ {2L = \frac{mc}{\nu}} $$</div>
                <br><div>$$ {\nu = \frac{mc}{2L}} $$</div>
                <br>
               A resonator may support several standing waves of slightly different wavelength, these are called longitudinal modes. Each mode has distinct frequency (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>&#x3bd;</mi></math>) as in equation (1).   <br>

             <br>He-Ne laser employs a four level pumping scheme. When the power (10kV)  is switched on , the electric field ionizes the gas atoms and ions move towards oppositely charged electrode . Electron lighter in weight hence gain higher velocity and He atoms excited more readily because they are lighter in weight .<br>

             <br>Atoms in E3 collected undergo spontaneous emission to reach E2 .E2 is a metastable state in Neon .So,  there is a chance of accumulation of atoms in this state.The atoms in E2 are de-energized by keeping diameter of the discharge  tube small . So that number of collisions with the tube walls takes away energy of atoms in E2 and they rapidly reach ground state to get excited to E6 and E4 again. The discharge is maintained continuously thus this cycle of events continues , giving out a continuous laser output.

            <br><br><b>Principle:</b>Optically pumped Nd-YAG rod inside the resonant cavity undergoes stimulated emission and light thus produced gets amplified in the cavity to produce Nd -YAG laser.
            <br><b>Construction:</b>Nd-YAG assembly consists of an elliptically cylindrical cavity that has Nd-YAG rod along if one focal axis and Xenon flash lamp at the other as shown in Figure 2a.7.1b. 
            The cavity is silvered internally so that light leaving the lamp at one focus meets the rod at other focus after every reflection. Thus, light is focused on the rod. Two ends of the rod are polished and silvered for resonator formation as shown in Figure 2a.7.1a.

            <br><b>Working:</b>As shown in Figure 2a.7.2 the energy level of Nd. E1 is the ground state and E3 is the metastable state. Light in the range 5000-8000 A0 is used to pump the Nd +3 ions that act as active centres to higher states.
            <br>E3 is the metastable state that gets rapidly populated due to downward transitions from higher energy levels as none of them is metastable. Thus population inversion takes place between E3 and E2. Thus by resonant cavity action with help of pumping a Continuous laser of 1.06 µm in IR region is given out between E3 and E2.

                    <b></b><br>
                    <br><b>Principle:  </b>When a current higher than a Threshold value is passed in a forward bias on junction that is basically doped it emits a laser that is called semiconductor diode laser.
                    <br><b>Construction:</b>A diode is heavily doped for the purpose of being used as a semiconductor diode laser. The semiconductor diode is of the order 1mm in size. The front and the rear ends of the diode are polished perpendicular to the junction in order to create a resonator cavity. The thin junction here acts as the active region as shown in Figure 2a.8.1. 
                    <br><br><div class="imgee">

                    </div>
                    <br><b>Working:</b>A heavily doped pn junction is forward biased. This puts fermi level within conduction band. So, on heavily doped p side the acceptor levels enter with   into the valence band creating holes in valence band. Zero bias condition is shown at the top of the adjoining Figure 2a.8.2.
                    When a forward bias is applied zero bias changes to the condition shown below, electrons injected into depletion region hence it's holes appear in lower region. Low forward bias current causes spontaneous emissions of photons at the junction due to electron hole pair recombination.
                    When the forward bias current increases <b>threshold value</b> carrier concentration increases to very high value. The narrow region where this is achieved is called active region. Forward bias current plays the role of pumping agent in diode lasers. eg. In GaAs laser light of 9000 A° in IR. GaAsP in visible region red colour 6500 A°. Diode laser are simple, efficient low power compact, less monochromatic and highly temperature sensitive.

                    <br>A Photograph records a two-dimensional record of a three-dimensional scene where the information of the third dimension is lost. While a hologram is the three-dimensional record of a three-dimensional scene. Thus, the hologram is "holos" which means "complete" and “gram” that means a “record” in greek.
                    The process of creating a 3D image “Hologram” is called holography it has two main stages namely recording and reading they are described as follows:
                    <br><b>Recording hologram:</b>
                    <br>A broad LASER beam is incident on the object to be recorded. The wave scattered from object called the object beam is made to interfere with a coherent unscattered wave (reference beam) to obtain interference pattern that becomes the record of phase information i.e. 3rd dimension.
                    The hologram thus obtained is similar to the image as in case of photograph. On the contrary, it consists of alternate bright and dark bands (interference pattern) that have phase information to give additional 3rd dimension information as shown in Figure 2a.9.1.

                            <br>Transfer of information from one place to another is called communication. For communication to occur a system should consist of following three main parts as shown in Figure 2b.7.1:
                            <br><ol type="A">
                                <li>Transmitter (T)</li><br>
                                <li>Receiver (R)</li><br>
                                <li>Channel for propagation of information from (T) to (R) </li><br>
                            </ol>
                            <br>Fibre optic communication system is specialized in a sense that the information propagates in the form of light and hence the transmitter and receiver in this type of system has additional components to support this modification. A block diagram for a typical optical fibre communication system is shown in the figure below. 
                            <br>
                            Principle Elements of typical Fibre optical communication system are:
                            <br><ol type="1">
                                <li><strong>Input Device</strong>:A typical input device would be a Telephone or mike in case of a voice input to be transmitted across the channel to the receiver.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Encoder</strong>:This is the special device in the Receiver that converts light from the optical fiber to electrical signal. Eg. Photodiode.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Optical transmitter</strong>: This is the special device in the transmitter that converts electrical signal to light and launches it appropriately to propagate through the optical fibre. E.g. LED.</li>
                                <li><br><strong>Optical Fibre</strong>:This is the three-layered fibre consisting of a core-cladding interface covered in a sheath. The information propagates through the core in the form of light due to the phenomenon of total internal reflection in a zig – zag manner. </li><br>
                                <li><strong>Optical receiver</strong>:This is the special device in the Receiver that converts light from the optical fiber to electrical signal. Eg. Photodiode.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Decoder</strong>:This block collects the signal from the Optical receiver, removes the high frequency carrier as and when required and converts electrical signal from the optical receiver into a user understandable output (Audio).</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Output Device</strong>:A typical output device would be a Telephone or speaker in case a voice output is expected at the receiver end.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Repeater</strong>:A typical amplification device suitable for long distance communication through optical fibres.</li><br>

                            <br>The advantages of using a fibre optic communication system are:
                            <br><ol type="1">
                                <li><strong>Greater Bandwidth</strong>: Fibre optic cables provide more bandwidth than copper cables of the same diameter, in carrying more data. </li><br>
                                <li><strong>Faster Speeds</strong>: Fibre optic cables have a centre that carries light to transmit data. This allows fibre optic cables to carry signals at a faster pace.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Better Reliability</strong></li>: Fibre optic cable is immune to temperature changes, severe weather and moisture, all of which can hamper the connectivity of copper cable. Plus, fibre doesn't carry current, so it’s not bothered by electromagnetic interference (EMI) which will interrupt data transmission.
                                <li><br><strong>Thinner and Sturdier</strong>: In comparison to copper cables, fibre optic cables are lighter and thinner. They are also less susceptible to breakage and can also withstand a higher amount of pull and pressure.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Lower Total Cost of Ownership</strong>: Although some fibre optic cables may have a better initial cost than copper, the sturdiness and reliability of fibre can make the entire cost of ownership (TCO) lower. Day by day costs continue to decrease for fibre optic cables as technology advances.</li><br>
